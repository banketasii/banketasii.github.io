# Patatap Clone Project

This is a clone of Patatap from https://patatap.com/
Instead of having all the fancy designs, this one just has a sound playing with a colored circle disappearing.


* Howler.js was used for the sounds.

* Paper.js was used for the drawing.

Press any key to make a circle show and a sound play.  The circle will gradually disappear.
